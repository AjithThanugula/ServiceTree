      "Description": "The AI Platform team strives to provide the best platform for 1st and 3rd party developers and data scientists to build, deploy, and evaluate AI powered applications. We enable a data-driven culture, and infuse AI across Microsoft.\n\nOur team is structured in three areas:\n1.\tPre-built AI\n2.\tCustom AI\n3.\tData and Experimentation\n\nWe are driven by the following principles in thinking about our work\n•\tSingle Product. While we have three lenses through which we look, we expect all our efforts to compose into an integrated product suite.\n•\t1P == 3P. We will insist that the platforms we develop for 3rd party developers are exactly the same ones that our 1st party developers use. We acknowledge that there may be minor feature differences, but we want the platforms to be the same.  This enables both our 3rd and 1st party customers to benefit from the best of both ecosystems.\n•\tCustomer Focused. We drive our investments by partnering closely with our customers to understand their needs even deeper than they understand their needs themselves, and deliver fantastic experiences based on that.\n•\tInnovation driven. We balance the focus on customers with a focus on innovation as we know that AI is moving tremendously quickly, and technical innovation will drive and draw customers quickly to our platform.\n•\tSimple products. AI is a very difficult space, so we will focus on making products that are simple for our customers to understand and to use.\n•\tLive site focused. Our customers demand an enterprise class experience, and we will use a live site first approach to create that.",
